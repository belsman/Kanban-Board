<h1 align="center">üï¥Ô∏è Kanban Board API (backend) üï¥Ô∏è</h1>

> This is an API that provides resources for a Kanban Board. The API provides endpoints that lets users manage resources such as Boards, Lists, Cards -- similar to what Trello does behind the scene.

### ‚ú® [A Frontend project that consumes this API can be found here!](https://github.com/belsman/trello-ui-clone)

## How the Project Works
- A user creates a token by using registration or login endpoints
- The user can then perform CRUD operations on Board, List, Card by using the token with the appropriate endpoints and method calls.


## API EndPoints

```ENDPOINT``` = [http://example.com](http://example.com)
### Endpoints for Authentication

| POST      | /register/ | Registers a new user to obtain token |
| POST      | /login/ | Login in an existing user to obtain token |
| GET      | /auth-user/ | Return current user |
